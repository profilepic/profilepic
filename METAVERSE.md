What is a PFP?

PFP is an acronym for profile picture, a common feature of social media platforms (e.g. Twitter, Twitch, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.)

What do people use for as a PFP? Anything!

PFPs predate the internet, but become much more interesting at
internet scale e.g. Facebook was built to improve on the physical Harvard "facebook"

PFPs are a subset of a broader model of virtual visual identities, that is, 
from Avatars (Gaming) to PFPs (social media)

PFPs are about identity
e.g. a) Personal Identity/(ies), b) Community Belonging, c) Branding / Recall 

PFPs provide insight into the user and the culture of their online
community

People can have multiple, possibly overlapping, identities 
e.g. a) Professional Identity, b) Community Identity, c) Avocational Identity

People have been shown to use between 3 to 5 different PFPs
across different platforms

- Users' perceptions of each platform and the platform's audience
  impact how they present their online identity.
- The users have definite ideas about the types of audiences they
  attract on each platform and make conscious efforts to shape
  their depictions accordingly. 

People sometimes use pseudonymous identities

The Federalist Papers, in favor of ratification of The Constitution,
were written by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison

- The papers were published under the pseudonym "Publius"
- Pseudonymity may be used for various reasons:
  - To separate identities
  - To clarify messaging
  - To protect the author

PFP Collections

Case Study 1: Matt & John's® Punks V1/V2 a.k.a "CryptoPunks" - 24x24 Pixel Art

Matt & John's® Punks V1/V2 a.k.a. "CryptoPunks" began as generative collectibles, not as PFPs

- Collection of 10,000 Non-Fungible Tokens randomly generated collectible 
  characters based on a set of attributes 
  with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum Blockchain.

- Originally free to claim in June 2017. Today, they range in price from
  approximately $90,000 for the majority of punks to $5M to $10M for the "rarest" punk token.

- Larva Labs Bros. introduced the first collection built-in decentralised marketplace,
  including royalty free trading. Matt & John kept 10% of the supply and the Intellectual Property (IP) and
  copyright of the whole collection.



Matt & John's® Punks V2 are (fine) art? (token) collectibles? PFPs?

Influencers started using Matt & John's® Punks as PFPs  (on Twitter) e.g
@gmoneynft (January 2021), @punk4156 (February 2021), ...

Social capital, social bond, self-image / branding 

1) Social Capital -  Matt & John's® Punks are viewed as signaling "cryptonative" – 
   that someone was either early enough or willing to sacrifice enough capital to send this signal

2) Social Bond - The use of a Matt & John's® Punk opens the opportunity to connect with like minded
     individuals. "Punk follow punk" and the punks discord group are networking examples

3)  Self-image / Branding - Allows for a form of personal branding / recall and, if desired, pseudonymity



Case Study 2: Bored Apes Yacht Club (BAYC) 

Bored Apes Yacht Club (BAYC) introduced the "utility" era of PFPs

Collection of 10,000 Non-Fungible Tokens randomly generated collectible characters based on
a set of traits with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum Blockchain.

- Originally 0.08 ETH to claim in April 2021, now they need to be bought at
  secondary market. Commercial rights are granted to the PFP owner.
- Yuga heavily emphasized utility:
  - Access to virtual clubhouse
  - Commercial rights
  - Physical events ("Apefest" parties)
  - Airdrops
  - A game/metaverse (Otherside) - SOON!

Yuga offered additional benefits to token-holders

- Physical Events - 4-Day ApeFest 2022, Pier 17 @ New York City
- Airdrops -   Bored Ape Kennel Club,  Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Ape Coin (APE), Otherdeed for Otherside (Metaverse SOON!)



Many PFP collections are experimenting with "utility" models

- Branded Physical goods / Moonbirds (by Proof Collective)
-  Special (Non-Fungible) Token collections only available to (Non-Fungible) Token holders /
Proof Collective 
-  Access to market reports / Degenz
-  Access to services / WGMI.io



Case Study 3: The Nouns PFP - One Noun (Pixel Art) Every Day, Forever

- Distribution mechanism: Daily auction of 1 noun, the proceeds are sent to Nouns DAO treasury.
- Nouns artwork is on-blockchain and in the public domain / CC0
- Nouns are members of Nouns DAO. 1 Noun = 1 Vote.
- Treasury is controlled exclusively by Nouns
- Nounders (founders) receive one Noun of every ten
- Strong focus on open-source building

3D (Non-Fungible) Token based avatar collections are in their infancy


PFPs as a publicly readable community database?

- You can create applications for Matt & John's® Punks V1/V2 
  without knowing anything about the holders

- This feels like something very new, almost unexplored  


Valuation - Why do people pay so much for a profile picture (PFP?

Key Outstanding Issues In PFPs

- Valuation – What is the "right" price for a PFP?
- Utility in PFP collections:
  - Does it mean anything?
  - Does it create securities legislation risk?
- Which licensing model will be more effective? Commercial licenses vs CC0 (public domain licenses)?
- Are PFPs communities or customers?
- Are PFPs are an art/culture field or a fast fashion field?
- What are sustainable revenue models for PFPs? Primary Sales? Royalties? Products and Services? 


Takeaways / Learnings from week 3

- PFPs are a subset of a broader model of visual virtual identities, 
  providing insights user and the culture of their (possibly multiple and overlapping) online communities.
- PFPs may support user pseudonymity - interestingly, research shows that effects from PFP use may
  be bilateral.
-  Most PFP projects today issue either commercial licenses or are in the public domain (CC0). 
  Newer collections are experimenting with other models, such as utility.
- PFP collections can even be thought of as publicly readable community databases, supporting
  application creation without real knowledge about PFP holders – still an unexplored area.


PFPs remain at a nascent stage, 
with many outstanding issues: valuation, utility, licensing model, revenue model, etc.
